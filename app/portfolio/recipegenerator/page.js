            <h1>Recipe Generator</h1>
            <p>This project was self initiated and completed over the summer. </p>
            <div className='descriptiontext'>
            <p> This project was inspired by ChatGPT and how we can leverage on advancements in natural language processing to bring value. One such area I noticed lacking was a convenient way of
                searching for recipe ideas and having them all processed into a single webpage with inputs from the local grocer, NTUC. Hence, this project was born aiming at amateur home cooks and 
                even professional chefs.
